# Secure-Network-Design

The project entails creating a secure network diagram for a small or mid-sized company as part of transitioning towards a security-focused approach. As the newly appointed Network Security Engineer, the task involves visualizing the network infrastructure, understanding the flow of information, and incorporating security measures to ensure defense in depth.

The provided solution outlines the implementation of various security features such as DMZ, VLAN, VPN, Access Control Lists (ACL), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Firewall, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). These features are strategically deployed within the network architecture to safeguard against potential threats and unauthorized access.

The network diagram depicts different departments within the company, each treated as a subsystem, with dedicated servers and security measures tailored to their specific needs. For instance, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is established to house critical servers like Mail, Database, and FTP servers, limiting access to internal and external users while mitigating damage in case of compromise.

Furthermore, the diagram illustrates the use of VLANs to segregate network traffic, Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control access to sensitive information, and VPNs to enable secure remote access for employees. The Administration department, handling sensitive data, receives enhanced security measures, including a dedicated FTP server and stringent authentication requirements.

Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's network infrastructure and security posture, serving as a foundation for proposing equipment procurement or configuration changes to enhance network security. Effective communication of technical concepts to stakeholders, considering their varying levels of technical expertise, is crucial in conveying the importance and benefits of the proposed security measures.
